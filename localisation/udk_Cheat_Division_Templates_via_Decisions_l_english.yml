udk_Cheat_Division_Templates_via_Decisions_desc: "These templates are general outlines for what you should be using.\n\nDon't forget that your Army Doctrines matter a lot, so it's suggested to adjust templates to your preferances (Do not go beyond 38 combat width or under 15).\n\n Don't waste your game with superior fire power. \n\nFor tanks you do either mobile warfare for breakthrough and organization; or Deep battle for a mix between Grand battle plan and mass mobe right (better on majors that do infantry + tanks). \n\nGBP is not to be snoozed on 80-105% planning bonus is very good. \n\nDeep battle (mass mobe left) with brick infantry (i.e 35/36 width marine or mountaineer divisions) + force attack and green air w/CAS is significantly better defensively and just as good offensively as infantry on superior firepower + artillery\nBUT if you are spamming just infantry with AT and support companies, stick with mass mobe right (mass mobilization)\n\nTemplates will be very basic, no flame tank or SPG or TD or other Niche Units.\nYou can easily modify templates.\nDecisions are repeatable after 1 day.\n\n Highly recommend support companies \nFlametanks | Light tanks for forest, mountains and hills | Mediums are jack of all trades master of none | Heavies for Plains, forts and urban \n Field hospitals for the trickleback on infantry minors and the additional HP in general | Logi companies for supply usage \n\n Last stand is your best friend on infantry divisions. Do not last stand your entire army just create a new army or have a army with 1 division to quickly move divisions into and press last stand (On infantry only not tanks never) \n\n§RWARNING:§!\nIf you don't have necessary technology for Units such as Mech or Marines, That Division's details will show everything related to that unit wrong. Researching necessary tech will fix this.You can see which tech you missing via hovering on Red exclamation mark in Equipment Button inside that template."

To oversimplfy last stand and force attack; clicking these buttons will ~freeze your organization (green bar) and in exchange your strength (orange bar) will tick down. Therefore you want high HP on ports in order to delay the invasion as long as possible and drain the enemy of organization, stregnth and command power (as they are force attacking you while invading). Obviously it is preferable if you to put 36 width bricks on the sides of the port to protect them if the IC avaliable allows it. But 16 widths arent the end of the world if they are on the sides of ports"
